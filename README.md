# TriviaGame

A  Game of Thrones themed trivia I created while enrolled in the Fullstack Bootcamp at UT.

It uses bootstrap and css for the layout and styling, and jQuery & javascript for the logic.

It can be modified fairly easily to increase the number of questions in the trivia.

The following image displays what the users will see when they first visit the site:
